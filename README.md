## üèÉRun Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bilallgunaydin/OPTIIMSDETAssessmentUseCase.git
```

```bash
  Run "TestNG.xml" file
```
![results report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e49f6705-f85f-47c1-bb33-5c17529631ed)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not:** If the allure results file is not created in the target, it is created in the main directory. This is because maven and lombok are not fully compatible. If allure result is not in the target, manually drop the Allure Result folder into the target file after Run. Then write the "mvn allure:serve" code in Terminal and run it. The test results will open in your browser as html with Allure reports.
